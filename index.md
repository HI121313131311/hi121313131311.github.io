## ⚙️ System Requirements

Before you download the application, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- **.NET Runtime:** .NET 8 or later must be installed. You can download the latest runtime from the official [Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## 📚 Additional Information

This application serves as a practical introduction to .NET development. By running the console application, you will learn how to interact with a SQL Server database using:

- **ADO.NET:** This is a set of classes that can be used to access and manipulate databases.
- **Dapper:** A simple object mapper for .NET, which provides a more user-friendly experience when interacting with databases.
- **EF Core:** Entity Framework Core is a modern data access technology that simplifies data manipulation in .NET applications.

Each approach has its benefits. ADO.NET gives you direct access to database operations, while Dapper offers ease of use, and EF Core provides a higher-level abstraction.
